# lsb requires /usr/bin/lpr which is provided by both, cups-client and lprng.
# Problem:
#   - only lprng gets lsb as referer
#   - remove list contains lsb despite /usr/bin/lpr is satisfied by cups-client
# XXX: whether or not lsb is in the remove list depends on the order they are
# checked in the solver which is not defined!
