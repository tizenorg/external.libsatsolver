<!-- typical Debian libc5->libc6 scenario: new libfoog conflicts with
     older versions of libfoo, but can coexist with newer ones. The -dev
     package needs the libc6 ('g') lib, the -dev pkg for the libc5 lib
     has been renamed to -altdev. The whole upgrade is triggered by an
     update of foouser, which has changed its requirement from libfoo to libfoog. -->
