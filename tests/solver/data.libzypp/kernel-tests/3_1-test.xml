(3) System Installation

    During system installation, we must make sure that only one kernel
    package gets installed, and that all KMPs that should be installed
    get installed.

    (3.1) KMP requests always to be installed

      A KMP can request always to be installed. For that, each
      some-kmp-$flavor package has a `Supplements: kernel-$flavor' tag.
      The package that matches the installed kernel-$flavor package
      gets installed.

      The novfs-kmp-$flavor packages use this mechanism. Make sure that
      the novfs-kmp package that matches the kernel gets installed.
