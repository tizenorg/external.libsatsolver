<!-- 
    (1.2) Kernel ABI has changed

      The KMPs and the kernel become incompatible. This results in
      a mismatch in kernel(name) = version Provides of the kernel and
      requires of the KMP. The resolver should indicate a conflict to
      be resolved interactively.

      (1.2.1) No updated some-kmp-$flavor packages are available

	The resolver should propose to either install the new kernel and
	remove the KMP, keep the KMP and the old kernel, or possibly
	ignore the conflict and still install the new kernel.
