(3) System Installation

    During system installation, we must make sure that only one kernel
    package gets installed, and that all KMPs that should be installed
    get installed.
    (3.2) Package requires a KMP

      A package has a `Requires: some-kmp' tag. Each of the
      some-kmp-$flavor packages has a `Provides: some-kmp =
      version-release' tag. The some-kmp-$flavor package matching the
      installed kernel should get installed.

      The tpctl package employs this mechanism. Make sure that when
      tpctl is selected, the tpctl-kmp-$flavor package matching the
      installed kernel is installed as well. (This case is discussed in
      bug 156513).
