(2) KMP Update

    This case triggers when a KMP becomes available on an installation
    source ("catalog") that has a higher [epoch/]version/release number
    that the installed KMP.

    (2.2) The kABI of the kernel and of the KMP differ

      (2.2.1) No kernel with the new kABI is available

	The new KMP cannot be installed. The resolver should show this
	as a conflict that cannot be resolved. (Uninstalling the kernel
	is not a viable option.)
