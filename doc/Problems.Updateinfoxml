Problems with updateinfo.xml

- no translation of summary/description
- issued date not uniq resp. fine-granular enough
- kinda stupid: reboot_suggested for -devel
           <package arch="i386" name="dbus-devel" release="9.fc8" ...
           ...
	     <reboot_suggested>True</reboot_suggested>
	   </package>
- reboot_suggested is per-package !
